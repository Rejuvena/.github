# Rejuvena

> *Redefining tModLoader, one unfinished project at a time.*

---

We are a team of C# programmers and Terraria modders aiming to create and unique and interesting experience through mods. Many of our projects hold relevancy outside of Terraria, being capable of aiding people in the wider C# space. Put simply, Rejuvena is a passion project.

Our three biggest goals for Terraria modding are:
1. developing and fine-tuning a powerful ModCompile alternative ((rejuvena/collate)[https://github.com/rejuvena/collate]) to better convenience mod developers;
2. craft a powerful base library mod that makes everyone's development jobs easier, with many abstractions, cross-version safety, and more;
2. create a unique content mod for Terraria that focuses on the expansion of content and fleshing out of undeveloped vanilla ideas (and more, but that's where we're starting).

Everything here is made with the express goal of just having fun and bettering the community.

## Mod Libraries/Utilities
Mod libraries and utility programs aiming to enhance mod development and programmer quality-of-life.

#### [tea-framework](https://github.com/rejuvena/tea-framework)
A framework for modding built on top of tModLoader, abstracts a lot of fickle features and implementations away in order to provide stability for modders. Adds in numerous additional features as well, which will be supported through updates that mods will not have to worry about.

#### [fluent](https://github.com/rejuvena/fluent)
**Currently postponed.**
A library for adding in custom modded liquids.

#### [build-configurer](https://github.com/rejuvena/build-configurer)
Designed for the collate toolchain, build-configurer is a simple tool for generating build.txt files.

TODO: Terraprisma is DEAD.
## Terraprisma
The bootstrapper project.

#### [terraprisma](https://github.com/rejuvena/terraprisma)
A bootstrapper designed for single-loading advanced patch-heavy mods. Similar to injecting mods such as OptiFine for Minecraft. These are capable of transforming the entire game prior to the assembly being properly loaded. -->
