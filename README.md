# Rejuvena
**Redefining tModLoader, one unfinished project at a time.**

Rejuvena, as an organization is—to put it simply—a passion project made by [myself](https://tomat.dev) for two purposes:
1. Creating a custom mod development tool chain that improves development significantly.
2. Creating a geuinely decent content mod for 1.4 to satiate people's hunger.

Everything here is made with the express goal of just having fun.
